CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

This file lays out what we expect from contributors and participants in our project. It sets the standards for a respectful and inclusive community.
Note from Moe: I think the Contributor Covenant thingy sounds like a well thought out thing and would like to add it. 
Before we switch to public, we need to check this file if there are any copyright issues etc. (Are we quoting as expected etc.?)

## Our Standards

**Encouraged Behavior:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.

- Trolling, derogatory remarks, or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Disclosing private information without explicit permission.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are tasked with clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective actions in response to any conduct they find inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and whenever an individual represents the community publicly.

## Enforcement

Report instances of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior by contacting the project team at [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
