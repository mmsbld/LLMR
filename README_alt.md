# LLMR

*Run and Share Language Models with Ease*

LLMR is an intuitive application that lets you select and run language models via APIs without needing to write code. Customize model parameters like temperature, top_p, and system prompts, and then share a link for clients to interact with the model—no login required on the client side. All chat histories are logged and archived locally, with built-in support for exporting PDFs.
