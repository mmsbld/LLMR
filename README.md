# LLMRunner

*Effortless Model Deployment and Customization*

---

LLMR is an open-source application for empirically investigating interactions with various large language models (LLMs). As a client-server solution, LLMR offers easy access to a variety of different LLMs. Subjects can chat with the LLM directly via a browser-based chat interface without having to register. All chat transcripts are automatically recorded, clearly managed in the integrated explorer and can be exported at any time.

LLMR integrates seamlessly with both Hugging Face’s Serverless Inference API and OpenAI’s API, providing access to a wide range of models, including the latest versions of ChatGPT. Through this interface, you can fine-tune settings to optimize performance and output for specific scenarios.
